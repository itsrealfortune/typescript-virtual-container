## Branch and Commit Style

- Keep commits small and descriptive.
- Prefer conventional commit prefixes when possible:
  - feat:

## Coding Guidelines

- Use TypeScript with explicit, readable types.
- Avoid introducing any without a strong reason.
- Preserve existing API behavior unless the change is intentional and documented.
- Keep command behavior deterministic for tests and CI use cases.

## Pull Request Checklist
